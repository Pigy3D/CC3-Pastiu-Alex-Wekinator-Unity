# CC3-Pastiu Alex Wekinator-Unity
Wekinator Unity Project

~~Description:

This project is a simple platformer working in Unity through Wekinator and the Various Audio Inputs program that captures sound from the microhpone.

~~Quickstart:

-Clone this repository.

-Open Various_Audio_Inputs.exe | Path: Pastiu Alex- CC3 Wekinator Unity\Various_Audio_Inputs_win64\bin

-Open Wekinator. Then File>Open Project and select silence-A-I-R training.wekproj | Path: Pastiu Alex- CC3 Wekinator Unity\silence-A-I-R training

-Run the Wekinator model

-Run the Play Maker Tests.exe Unity Build | Path: Pastiu Alex- CC3 Wekinator Unity\Unity Build

Done. All ports should be already set. The Unity build should open and you should be able to control the red square using your voice.

Voice Commands:
1- Silence- Idle, cube falls
2- AAAA- Left, cube should go Left
3- III- Right, cube should go Right
4- RRR- Up, cube should go Up

Note: The Wekinator model sometimes hears noise and interprets it as RRR, sending the cube upwards. Results may vary. The Wekinator model can be retrained for better results according to your environment.
